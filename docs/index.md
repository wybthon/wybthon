# Wybthon

Wybthon is a client-side Python SPA framework that runs in the browser via Pyodide.

## What is Wybthon?

Build interactive web apps in Python that execute entirely in the browser. Wybthon provides a Virtual DOM renderer, reactive primitives, routing, forms, and DOM/event interop, all designed for Pyodide.

## Features

- Virtual DOM renderer with function and class components
- Reactive primitives: `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `batch`, and `use_resource`
- Router with path params, query parsing, and a `Link` component
- Contexts and a `Provider` component
- DOM helpers and event delegation
- Forms state, validators, and bindings
- Dev server with hot-reload (SSE)

## Quickstart

1) Clone the repo and run the demo:

```bash
python -m http.server
# open http://localhost:8000/examples/demo/index.html
```

2) Or run the dev server with auto-reload:

```bash
pip install .
wyb dev --dir .
```

3) Explore the demo app in `examples/demo` and the API in the Concepts and API sections.
