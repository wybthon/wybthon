Wybthon
=======

Wybthon is a Python-first, client-side UI framework for building interactive web
apps in the browser (via Pyodide). It combines a React-style component model with
context, fine-grained reactivity, a virtual DOM, routing, forms, events, and lazy
loading, so you can write modern frontends entirely in Python, no JavaScript required.
For guides, API reference, and examples, see the [docs](https://docs.wybthon.com/).
